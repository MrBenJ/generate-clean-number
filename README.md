## Usage

Generate Clean Number provides 2 methods for generating a clean number (removing unwanted characters).

### `generateCleanNumber`

`generateCleanNumber` uses regex to remove unwanted characters from numbers. Just a ternary but may be less performant if many numbers are being trimmed.

```javascript

import {
  generateCleanNumber
} from 'generate-clean-number'

const nowCleanNumber = generateCleanNumber(<someNumber>) 

```

### `filterNaNfromNumber`

`filterNaNfromNumber` turns a number into an array and strips non-number characters from it before returning a number. 

```javascript

import {
  filterNaNfromNumber
} from 'generate-clean-number'

const nowCleanNumber = filterNaNfromNumber(<someNumber>) 

```
